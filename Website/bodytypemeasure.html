                        Body mass index (BMI) is a medical screening tool that measures the ratio of your height to your weight to estimate the amount of body fat you have. Healthcare providers calculate BMI by using weight in kilograms (kg) divided by the square of height in meters (m2).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In most people, BMI correlates to body fat — the higher the number, the more body fat you may have — but it’s not accurate in some cases. BMI alone does not diagnose health. Healthcare providers use BMI and other tools and tests to assess someone’s health status and risks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You should not use the standard BMI chart to evaluate a child’s or teenager’s weight</p>

                    <p>Correlating to your BMI, your body fat percentage is a measure of the amount of fat present in your body.</p>
                    <p>Proteins are large, complex molecules that play many critical roles in the body. They are
                        necessary for building the structural components of the human body, such as muscles and organs.
                        Proteins also determine how the organism looks, how well its body metabolises food or fights
                        infection and sometimes even how it behaves. Proteins are chains of chemical building blocks
                        called amino acids. A protein may contain a few amino acids or it could have several thousands
                    </p>
                    <p>Sometimes, gene variants (also known as mutations) prevent one or more proteins from working
                        properly. By changing a gene’s instructions for making a protein, a variant can cause a protein
                        to malfunction or to not be produced at all.</p>

                <div class="bodyTypeListText">
                    <p>One of the proteins produced by the human body is myostatin.</p>
                    <p>Myostatin is a protein naturally produced by the human body that regulates skeletal muscle growth. By inhibiting muscle fiber size and number, myostatin plays a key role in controlling muscle mass across various species, from fish to humans. A deficiency in myostatin can lead to significant muscle overgrowth, which has made it a promising target for treating muscle-wasting disorders.</p>
                    <p>Genetics, including variations in myostatin levels, can partly explain why some individuals respond better to exercise than others. However, it’s important to remember that regardless of genetic factors, everyone has the potential to build an impressive physique with dedication and hard work.</p>
