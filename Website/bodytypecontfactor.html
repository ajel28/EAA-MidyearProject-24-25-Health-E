                    <p>
                        Metabolism refers to all the chemical processes going on continuously inside your body that
                        allow life and normal functioning (maintaining normal functioning in the body is called
                        homeostasis). These processes include those that break down nutrients from our food, and those
                        that build and repair our body.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Metabolism regulates:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Breathing</li>
                        <li>Circulating blood</li>
                        <li>Digesting food</li>
                        <li>Growing and repairing cells.</li>
                        <li>Managing hormone levels</li>
                        <li>Regulating body temperature</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Your metabolic rate is influenced by many factors – including age, gender, muscle-to-fat ratio,
                        amount of physical activity and hormone function.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Amount of body fat – fat cells are ‘sluggish’ and burn far fewer kilojoules than most other
                            tissues and organs of the body.</li>
                        <li>Crash dieting, starving or fasting – eating too few kilojoules encourages the body to slow
                            the metabolism to conserve energy. Metabolism can drop by up to 15% and if lean muscle
                            tissue is
                            also lost, this further reduces metabolism.</li>
                        <li>Age – metabolism slows with age due to loss of muscle tissue, but also due to hormonal and
                            neurological changes.</li>
                        <li>Gender – generally, men have faster metabolisms because they tend to be larger.</li>
                        <li>Genetic predisposition – your metabolic rate may be partly decided by your genes.</li>
                        <li>Hormonal and nervous controls – metabolism is controlled by the nervous and hormonal
                            systems.
                            Hormonal imbalances can influence how quickly or slowly the body burns kilojoules.</li>
                        <li>Infection or illness – metabolism increases because the body has to work harder to build new
                            tissues
                            and to create an immune response.</li>
                        <li>Amount of physical activity – hard-working muscles need plenty of energy to burn. Regular
                            exercise increases muscle mass and teaches the body to burn kilojoules at a faster rate,
                            even
                            when at rest.</li>

            <li>Muscle Insertions</li>
            <div class="bodyTypeListFlexMI">
                <div class="bodyTypeListText">
                    <p>Muscle insertions are determined entirely by genetics. These insertions refer to the points where
                        muscles attach to bones and act as anchor points during contraction. While muscle insertions
                        generally don’t impact strength, they can significantly influence how a muscle appears.</p>
                    <p>For example, a "disconnected chest" insertion might be considered less desirable compared to
                        other chest insertions. On the other hand, aesthetics in areas like the biceps often come down
                        to personal preference.</p>
                    <p>It’s important to note that muscle insertions cannot be changed, no matter how much you train. However, what does make a difference is filling out your frame through consistent exercise. Building muscle and achieving a balanced physique is far more important than worrying about genetic features you can’t control.</p>

                    <p>Many people believe that you must be sore the next day in order to indicate a good workout.
                        However, this is not necessarily the case, especially for experienced lifters. You can still
                        have a great workout and not be sore the next day.</p>
                    <p>Soreness is NOT synonomous with muscle growth, and to certain extremes, can inhibit it. Excessive
                        exercise can lead to rhabdomyolysis, or a breakdown of the muscles in your body. Remember,
                        moderation is key.</p>

                    <p>Many people focus on the number on the scale, but it is not the best representation of body
                        changes.
                        The number on the scale is a factor of many things such as how much water you've drank, what you
                        ate
                        and what time you're weighing in.

                    <p>Often when a person loses a significant amount of weight, the number on the scale goes up because
                        of
                        building muscle from exercise.</p>

                    <p>If you want to accurately track your weight loss and muscle development, we recommend recording
                        measurements of arms, waist and thighs. And if you're going to use the scale, weigh in at the
                        same
                        time every day.</p>
