                        Genetics, genetics, genetics! It's common to see a friend making rapid progress at the gym and
                        feel demotivated if you're not seeing the same results. But here's the truth: while genetics can
                        play a role in your muscle-building journey, they don't have the final say. Your genetics may
                        influence factors like muscle insertions, body type, or natural strength, but how you develop
                        your physique is largely in your control.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Studies show that while genetic factors like muscle fiber composition or hormone levels can
                        impact performance, the key drivers of progress are still training intensity, recovery, and
                        nutrition. Research highlights that individuals who consistently follow a well-structured
                        training program and eat adequately to support muscle growth see similar gains over time,
                        regardless of their genetic makeup.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Blaming genetics for slow progress can actually hold you back. Consistency, patience, and a
                        willingness to
                        adapt will ultimately lead to results that speak for themselves.</p>

                    <p>In the 1940s, psychologist William H. Sheldon introduced the concept of different body types, or
                        somatotypes.</p>
                    <p>Per this classification, there are three different body types:
                    <p>Ectomorph: This is when the body is lean and slender and tends to have less body fat and muscle.
                        People with this body type can often find it challenging to gain weight in the form of muscle or
                        fat. Fashion models are an example of this body type.</p>
                    <p>Endomorph: This is when the body has more stored fat, lots of muscle, and gains weight easily.
                        People with this body type are not always overweight. Football lineman and Marilyn Monroe are
                        examples of this body type.</p>
                    <p> Mesomorph: This is when the body is athletic and strong. People with this body type are neither
                        overweight nor underweight. Swimmers and volleyball players are examples of this body type.</p>
                    <p>However, these bodytypes are quite outdated, and should be taken with a grain of salt. There is no 3 body types that can accurately classify 8 billion people. By restricting us to fixed types, it limits our perception of what we can achieve.</p>
