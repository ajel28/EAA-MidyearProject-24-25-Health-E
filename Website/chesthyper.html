                            A bench press is an exercise that can be used to strengthen the muscles of the upper body,
                            including the pectorals, arms, and shoulders. Depending on your goals, there are different
                            variations of bench presses that work slightly different muscles, too. For example, a
                            narrower grip bench press will put extra emphasis on the triceps and forearms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Other benefits of adding bench presses to your weight-training regimen include increasing
                            upper body strength, improving muscular endurance, and even preparing your upper body to do
                            movements like pushups. They also can be an effective strengthening exercise for sports like
                            sprinting, hockey, and football.</p>

                    <div class="Text">
                        <p>In the 1940s, psychologist William H. Sheldon introduced the concept of different body types,
                            or
                            somatotypes.</p>
                        <p>Per this classification, there are three different body types:
                        <p>Ectomorph: This is when the body is lean and slender and tends to have less body fat and
                            muscle.
                            People with this body type can often find it challenging to gain weight in the form of
                            muscle or
                            fat. Fashion models are an example of this body type.</p>
                        <p>Endomorph: This is when the body has more stored fat, lots of muscle, and gains weight
                            easily.
                            People with this body type are not always overweight. Football lineman and Marilyn Monroe
                            are
                            examples of this body type.</p>
                        <p> Mesomorph: This is when the body is athletic and strong. People with this body type are
                            neither
                            overweight nor underweight. Swimmers and volleyball players are examples of this body type.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, these bodytypes are quite outdated, and should be taken with a grain of salt. There
                            is
                            no 3 body types that can accurately classify 8 billion people. By restricting us to fixed
                            types,
                            it limits our perception of what we can achieve.</p>

                        <p>Many people believe that you must be sore the next day in order to indicate a good workout.
                            However, this is not necessarily the case, especially for experienced lifters. You can still
                            have a great workout and not be sore the next day.</p>
                        <p>Soreness is NOT synonomous with muscle growth, and to certain extremes, can inhibit it.
                            Excessive
                            exercise can lead to rhabdomyolysis, or a breakdown of the muscles in your body. Remember,
                            moderation is key.</p>

                        <p>Many people focus on the number on the scale, but it is not the best representation of body
                            changes.
                            The number on the scale is a factor of many things such as how much water you've drank, what
                            you
                            ate
                            and what time you're weighing in.

                        <p>Often when a person loses a significant amount of weight, the number on the scale goes up
                            because
                            of
                            building muscle from exercise.</p>

                        <p>If you want to accurately track your weight loss and muscle development, we recommend
                            recording
                            measurements of arms, waist and thighs. And if you're going to use the scale, weigh in at
                            the
                            same
                            time every day.</p>
